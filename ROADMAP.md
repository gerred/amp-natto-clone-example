# Node Flow - Development Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Philosophy

Based on our research, we're following a **constraint-driven, minimal footprint** approach:
- Start browser-first with Service Workers
- Use proven libraries (React Flow, RxJS, json-rules-engine)
- Address performance gaps early (1000-node limit, iOS Safari constraints)
- Build extensible interfaces for future scaling

## ðŸ“‹ Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal**: Working browser-only node editor with basic execution

### Phase 2: Streaming Engine (Weeks 5-8) 
**Goal**: Real-time streaming between nodes and widgets

### Phase 3: Constraint System (Weeks 9-12)
**Goal**: Smart execution environment selection

### Phase 4: Performance & Scale (Weeks 13-16)
**Goal**: Handle large workflows and multi-tab scenarios
