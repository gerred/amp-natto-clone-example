# Node Flow - Technical Specifications

This document provides an overview of all technical specifications for the Node Flow platform. Each specification covers a critical domain of the system architecture and implementation.

## üìã Specification Overview

Node Flow is a revolutionary node-based code execution platform that combines visual workflow creation with real-time interactivity and AI agent integration. The platform enables users and agents to create, execute, and monitor complex workflows through an intuitive interface with live widget feedback.

## üéØ Core Principles

### Agent-Native Design
The platform is designed with AI agents as primary users, enabling autonomous workflow creation, modification, and optimization without human intervention.

### Real-Time Interactivity
Live widgets provide immediate visual feedback during workflow execution, creating an immersive development and monitoring experience.

### Visual Programming
Node-based interface with drag-and-drop functionality makes complex workflow creation accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

### Scalable Architecture
Distributed, event-driven system designed to handle thousands of concurrent workflows with sub-100ms response times.

## üîÑ System Integration

The specifications are designed to work together as a cohesive system:
