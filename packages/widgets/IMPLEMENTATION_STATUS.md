### Documentation
- API documentation needs completion
- Integration guides need expansion
- More usage examples needed
- **Impact**: Developer experience, functionality is complete

## 📈 Usage and Integration

### Basic Widget Usage
```typescript
import { EnhancedChartWidget, emitToStream } from '@nodeflow/widgets';

// Real-time chart
<EnhancedChartWidget
  id="chart-1"
  streamId="data-stream"
  chartConfig={{ type: 'line' }}
  realTimeUpdate={true}
/>

// Emit data
emitToStream('data-stream', {
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  value: Math.random() * 100
});
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
import { usePerformanceMonitor } from '@nodeflow/widgets';

const { metrics, startMonitoring } = usePerformanceMonitor('widget-id');
// Real-time FPS, memory, and render metrics
```

### Custom Widget Development
```typescript
import { widgetFactory } from '@nodeflow/widgets';

const customType = {
  name: 'custom-widget',
  capabilities: { interactive: true, realtime: true }
};

widgetFactory.register(customType, CustomComponent);
```
