# Node Flow Execution Engine Specification

## Overview

The Node Flow Execution Engine is the core runtime system responsible for orchestrating workflow execution, managing node lifecycle, and providing real-time feedback to the visual interface. The engine is designed for high-throughput, low-latency execution with built-in fault tolerance and horizontal scalability.

## 1. Workflow Execution Model

### 1.1 Execution Graph
- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Workflows are modeled as DAGs where nodes represent operations and edges represent data dependencies
- **Topological Execution**: Nodes execute based on dependency resolution and data availability
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent branches execute concurrently to maximize throughput
- **Dynamic Graph Updates**: Support for modifying execution graph during runtime for conditional flows

### 1.2 Node Lifecycle
```
PENDING → QUEUED → RUNNING → [COMPLETED | FAILED | CANCELLED]
```
- **PENDING**: Node waiting for dependencies
- **QUEUED**: Ready for execution, waiting for worker availability
- **RUNNING**: Actively executing on a worker
- **COMPLETED**: Successful execution with output data
- **FAILED**: Execution failed with error details
- **CANCELLED**: Manually cancelled or cancelled due to downstream failure

### 1.3 Execution Modes
- **Real-time Mode**: Immediate execution with live updates
- **Batch Mode**: Scheduled execution for large datasets
- **Streaming Mode**: Continuous processing of data streams
- **Debug Mode**: Step-by-step execution with enhanced monitoring
