# Node Flow - Live Agent Execution Platform

A revolutionary node-based code execution platform that combines the workflow automation power of n8n/Flowise with the real-time interactivity of UE5 Blueprint live widgets. Built with an agent-first architecture for modern AI-driven development workflows.

## 🚀 Vision

Node Flow enables developers and AI agents to visually create, execute, and monitor complex workflows through an intuitive node-based interface with live, embedded widget views. Unlike traditional automation platforms, Node Flow provides real-time visual feedback and interactive components that update dynamically as your workflows execute.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Core Platform
- **Visual Node Editor**: Drag-and-drop workflow creation with intelligent node suggestions
- **Live Widget System**: Real-time embedded views showing live data, charts, and interactive components
- **Agent-Native Design**: Built for AI agents to create, modify, and optimize workflows autonomously
- **Multi-View Architecture**: Switch between canvas, code, and live execution views seamlessly

### 🔄 Execution Engine
- **Real-Time Processing**: Stream-based execution with live status updates
- **Hot-Swap Capability**: Modify running workflows without stopping execution
- **Distributed Architecture**: Scale across multiple workers and environments
- **Event-Driven**: Reactive system responding to real-time data and user interactions

### 🎨 User Experience
- **Live Debugging**: Visual breakpoints and step-through debugging in the canvas
- **Interactive Widgets**: Embedded UI components that respond to workflow state
- **Contextual Views**: Switch between design-time and runtime perspectives
- **Collaborative Editing**: Multi-user workflow development with real-time sync

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Canvas Engine**: Custom WebGL-based node editor with live rendering
- **Widget Framework**: Embeddable React components with streaming data binding
- **State Management**: Direct streaming with lightweight snapshots
- **Execution Runtime**: Service Workers for local execution + optional server scaling

### Backend Stack
- **Execution Runtime**: Node.js/TypeScript with worker thread pools
- **Event Stream**: Message queue system for workflow coordination
- **Plugin System**: Extensible node library with custom integrations
- **API Gateway**: GraphQL/REST APIs for workflow management and monitoring
